{"name":"eXtaminal Open Source","body":"### Welcome to eXtaminal&reg; Open Source\r\neXtaminal&reg; framework was born on 2005 and it is developed and maintained by <a href=\"http://www.genectiva.com/\">Genectiva</a>. Its purpose is to enable organisations to apply their functional and operation processes into IT. The commercial eXtaminal&reg; was developed to be hard, it was created to exist in a insecure environment like Internet. \r\n\r\nAs it is a modular framework, eXtaminal&reg; can be easily incremented with extra module to enhance organization functional requirements.\r\n\r\nIt was built to work with the Linux stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL and LDAP. In it's most recent commercial version, it integrates and run within a full Microsoft&trade; stack - Windows&trade;, IIS&trade;, SQL Server&trade; and Active Diretory&trade;.\r\n\r\nThe Open Source version works with CouchDB as an CouchApp making use of a commonly known User Interface Framework from Sencha - ExtJs.\r\n\r\n### Real life implementations\r\nIn its first version this framework was at work on various private and public organisations. One of the most demanding solutions was a Real Estate Franchising System embracing mixed technologies. As an integrated solution, eXtaminal&reg; was configured to manage not only the Real Estate Information as well as to manage Domain Users full life-cycle, users email, network user folders, VPN connections as well as data sync between stores and main office. All this in an environment where Enterprise Linux and Windows desktop OS work together.\r\n\r\nToday eXtaminal&reg; v2 is working mostly with governmental offices for tasks like the Study of Human Trafficking Phenomena within European Community. All its components are distributed and all communications are made by WebService Calls with military grade encryption. The framework evolved for a more technology embracing like Microsoft&trade; SQL Server and the authentication can now be done against LDAP or Active Dyrectory&trade;\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nObviously the author João Correia (@joaocac) and all the people that helped me somehow along the way Tânia Miguel, Bruno Vershteeg, Sá Correia, Pedro Cavaco, Telmo Santos, Ricardo Carvalho, Octávio Godinho, Luís Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with eXtaminal please contact support at genectiva dot com and we’ll help you sort it out.","tagline":"CouchApp Modular Intranet Framework System","google":"1622351","note":"Don't delete this file!
